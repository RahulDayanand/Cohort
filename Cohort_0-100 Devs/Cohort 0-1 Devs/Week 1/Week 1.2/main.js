/* 1. JS is interpretted language where code execution happens line by line 
and can run partially even if there is error in the code but where as in
compiled languages like C++,Java the code won't run when there is error 

2. JS is single threaded language,it can't use all cores of a machine at same time,
it can be achieved through cluster module

More practically JS runs line by line and only one line runs at a time

same happens with strict coding languages like java,c++ but it allows multithreading 
but JS doesn't
